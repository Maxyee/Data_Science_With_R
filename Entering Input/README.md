At the R prompt we type expressions. The <- symbol is the assignment operator

```
> x <- 1 
> print(x) 
[1] 1 
> x 
[1] 1 

> msg <- "hello
```

The grammer of the language determines whether an expression is complete or not.

```
x <- ## Incomplete expression
```

The # character indicates a comment.
Anything to the right of the #(including the # itself) is ignored. 
This is the only comment character in R.
Unlike some other languages,R does not support multi-line comments or comment blocks.
